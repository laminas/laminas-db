It is responsible for adapting any code written in or for laminas-db to the targeted PHP extensions and vendor databases. In doing this, it creates an abstraction layer for the PHP extensions in the Driver subnamespace of Laminas\\Db\\Adapter . It also creates a lightweight \"Platform\" abstraction layer, for the various idiosyncrasies that each vendor-specific platform might have in its SQL/RDBMS implementation, separate from the driver implementations. Creating an adapter using configuration Create an adapter by instantiating the Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter class. The most common use case, while not the most explicit, is to pass an array of configuration to the Adapter : use Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter; $adapter = new Adapter($configArray); This driver array is an abstraction for the extension level required parameters. Here is a table for the key-value pairs that should be in configuration array. Key Is Required? Value driver required Mysqli , Sqlsrv , Pdo_Sqlite , Pdo_Mysql , Pdo (= Other PDO Driver) database generally required the name of the database (schema) username generally required the connection username password generally required the connection password hostname not generally required the IP address or hostname to connect to port not generally required the port to connect to (if applicable) charset not generally required the character set to use Options are adapter-dependent Other names will work as well. Effectively, if the PHP manual uses a particular naming, this naming will be supported by the associated driver. For example, dbname in most cases will also work for 'database'. Another example is that in the case of Sqlsrv , UID will work in place of username . Which format you choose is up to you, but the above table represents the official abstraction names. For example, a MySQL connection using ext/mysqli: $adapter = new Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter([ 'driver' => 'Mysqli', 'database' => 'laminas_db_example', 'username' => 'developer', 'password' => 'developer-password', ]); Another example, of a Sqlite connection via PDO: $adapter = new Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter([ 'driver' => 'Pdo_Sqlite', 'database' => 'path/to/sqlite.db', ]); Another example, of an IBM i DB2 connection via IbmDb2: $adapter = new Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter([ 'database' => '*LOCAL', // or name from WRKRDBDIRE, may be serial # 'driver' => 'IbmDb2', 'driver_options' => [ 'autocommit' => DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_ON, 'i5_naming' => DB2_I5_NAMING_ON, 'i5_libl' => 'SCHEMA1 SCHEMA2 SCHEMA3', ], 'username' => '__USER__', 'password' => '__PASS__', // 'persistent' => true, 'platform' => 'IbmDb2', 'platform_options' => ['quote_identifiers' => false], ]); Another example, of an IBM i DB2 connection via PDO: $adapter = new Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter([ 'dsn' => 'ibm:DB_NAME', // DB_NAME is from WRKRDBDIRE, may be serial # 'driver' => 'pdo', 'driver_options' => [ // PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT => true, PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT => true, PDO::I5_ATTR_DBC_SYS_NAMING => true, PDO::I5_ATTR_DBC_CURLIB => '', PDO::I5_ATTR_DBC_LIBL => 'SCHEMA1 SCHEMA2 SCHEMA3', ], 'username' => '__USER__', 'password' => '__PASS__', 'platform' => 'IbmDb2', 'platform_options' => ['quote_identifiers' => false], ]); It is important to know that by using this style of adapter creation, the Adapter will attempt to create any dependencies that were not explicitly provided. A Driver object will be created from the configuration array provided in the constructor. A Platform object will be created based off the type of Driver class that was instantiated. And lastly, a default ResultSet object is created and utilized. Any of these objects can be injected, to do this, see the next section. The list of officially supported drivers: IbmDb2 : The ext/ibm_db2 driver Mysqli : The ext/mysqli driver Oci8 : The ext/oci8 driver Pgsql : The ext/pgsql driver Sqlsrv : The ext/sqlsrv driver (from Microsoft) Pdo_Mysql : MySQL via the PDO extension Pdo_Sqlite : SQLite via the PDO extension Pdo_Pgsql : PostgreSQL via the PDO extension Creating an adapter using dependency injection The more mezzio and explicit way of creating an adapter is by injecting all your dependencies up front. Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter uses constructor injection, and all required dependencies are injected through the constructor, which has the following signature (in pseudo-code): use Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Platform\\PlatformInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSet; class Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter { public function __construct( $driver, PlatformInterface $platform = null, ResultSet $queryResultSetPrototype = null ); } What can be injected: $driver : an array of connection parameters (see above) or an instance of Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\DriverInterface . $platform (optional): an instance of Laminas\\Db\\Platform\\PlatformInterface ; the default will be created based off the driver implementation. $queryResultSetPrototype (optional): an instance of Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSet ; to understand this object's role, see the section below on querying. Query Preparation By default, Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter::query() prefers that you use \"preparation\" as a means for processing SQL statements. This generally means that you will supply a SQL statement containing placeholders for the values, and separately provide substitutions for those placeholders. As an example: $adapter->query('SELECT * FROM `artist` WHERE `id` = ?', [5]); The above example will go through the following steps: create a new Statement object. prepare the array [5] into a ParameterContainer if necessary. inject the ParameterContainer into the Statement object. execute the Statement object, producing a Result object. check the Result object to check if the supplied SQL was a result set producing statement: if the query produced a result set, clone the ResultSet prototype, inject the Result as its datasource, and return the new ResultSet instance. otherwise, return the Result . Query Execution In some cases, you have to execute statements directly without preparation. One possible reason for doing so would be to execute a DDL statement, as most extensions and RDBMS systems are incapable of preparing such statements. To execute a query without the preparation step, you will need to pass a flag as the second argument indicating execution is required: $adapter->query( 'ALTER TABLE ADD INDEX(`foo_index`) ON (`foo_column`)', Adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE ); The primary difference to notice is that you must provide the Adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE (execute) flag as the second parameter. Creating Statements While query() is highly useful for one-off and quick querying of a database via the Adapter , it generally makes more sense to create a statement and interact with it directly, so that you have greater control over the prepare-then-execute workflow. To do this, Adapter gives you a routine called createStatement() that allows you to create a Driver specific Statement to use so you can manage your own prepare-then-execute workflow. // with optional parameters to bind up-front: $statement = $adapter->createStatement($sql, $optionalParameters); $result = $statement->execute(); Using the Driver Object The Driver object is the primary place where Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter implements the connection level abstraction specific to a given extension. To make this possible, each driver is composed of 3 objects: A connection: Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ConnectionInterface A statement: Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\StatementInterface A result: Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface Each of the built-in drivers practice \"prototyping\" as a means of creating objects when new instances are requested. The workflow looks like this: An adapter is created with a set of connection parameters. The adapter chooses the proper driver to instantiate (for example, Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\Mysqli ) That driver class is instantiated. If no connection, statement, or result objects are injected, defaults are instantiated. This driver is now ready to be called on when particular workflows are requested. Here is what the Driver API looks like: namespace Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver; interface DriverInterface { const PARAMETERIZATION_POSITIONAL = 'positional'; const PARAMETERIZATION_NAMED = 'named'; const NAME_FORMAT_CAMELCASE = 'camelCase'; const NAME_FORMAT_NATURAL = 'natural'; public function getDatabasePlatformName(string $nameFormat = self::NAME_FORMAT_CAMELCASE) : string; public function checkEnvironment() : bool; public function getConnection() : ConnectionInterface; public function createStatement(string|resource $sqlOrResource = null) : StatementInterface; public function createResult(resource $resource) : ResultInterface; public function getPrepareType() :string; public function formatParameterName(string $name, $type = null) : string; public function getLastGeneratedValue() : mixed; } From this DriverInterface , you can Determine the name of the platform this driver supports (useful for choosing the proper platform object). Check that the environment can support this driver. Return the Connection instance. Create a Statement instance which is optionally seeded by an SQL statement (this will generally be a clone of a prototypical statement object). Create a Result object which is optionally seeded by a statement resource (this will generally be a clone of a prototypical result object) Format parameter names; this is important to distinguish the difference between the various ways parameters are named between extensions Retrieve the overall last generated value (such as an auto-increment value). Now let's turn to the Statement API: namespace Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver; interface StatementInterface extends StatementContainerInterface { public function getResource() : resource; public function prepare($sql = null) : void; public function isPrepared() : bool; public function execute(null|array|ParameterContainer $parameters = null) : ResultInterface; /** Inherited from StatementContainerInterface */ public function setSql(string $sql) : void; public function getSql() : string; public function setParameterContainer(ParameterContainer $parameterContainer) : void; public function getParameterContainer() : ParameterContainer; } And finally, the Result API: namespace Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver; use Countable; use Iterator; interface ResultInterface extends Countable, Iterator { public function buffer() : void; public function isQueryResult() : bool; public function getAffectedRows() : int; public function getGeneratedValue() : mixed; public function getResource() : resource; public function getFieldCount() : int; } Using The Platform Object The Platform object provides an API to assist in crafting queries in a way that is specific to the SQL implementation of a particular vendor. The object handles nuances such as how identifiers or values are quoted, or what the identifier separator character is. To get an idea of the capabilities, the interface for a platform object looks like this: namespace Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Platform; interface PlatformInterface { public function getName() : string; public function getQuoteIdentifierSymbol() : string; public function quoteIdentifier(string $identifier) : string; public function quoteIdentifierChain(string|string[] $identiferChain) : string; public function getQuoteValueSymbol() : string; public function quoteValue(string $value) : string; public function quoteTrustedValue(string $value) : string; public function quoteValueList(string|string[] $valueList) : string; public function getIdentifierSeparator() : string; public function quoteIdentifierInFragment(string $identifier, array $additionalSafeWords = []) : string; } While you can directly instantiate a Platform object, generally speaking, it is easier to get the proper Platform instance from the configured adapter (by default the Platform type will match the underlying driver implementation): $platform = $adapter->getPlatform(); // or $platform = $adapter->platform; // magic property access The following are examples of Platform usage: // $adapter is a Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter instance; // $platform is a Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Platform\\Sql92 instance. $platform = $adapter->getPlatform(); // \"first_name\" echo $platform->quoteIdentifier('first_name'); // \" echo $platform->getQuoteIdentifierSymbol(); // \"schema\".\"mytable\" echo $platform->quoteIdentifierChain(['schema', 'mytable']); // ' echo $platform->getQuoteValueSymbol(); // 'myvalue' echo $platform->quoteValue('myvalue'); // 'value', 'Foo O\\\\'Bar' echo $platform->quoteValueList(['value', \"Foo O'Bar\"]); // . echo $platform->getIdentifierSeparator(); // \"foo\" as \"bar\" echo $platform->quoteIdentifierInFragment('foo as bar'); // additionally, with some safe words: // (\"foo\".\"bar\" = \"boo\".\"baz\") echo $platform->quoteIdentifierInFragment('(foo.bar = boo.baz)', ['(', ')', '=']); Using The Parameter Container The ParameterContainer object is a container for the various parameters that need to be passed into a Statement object to fulfill all the various parameterized parts of the SQL statement. This object implements the ArrayAccess interface. Below is the ParameterContainer API: namespace Laminas\\Db\\Adapter; use ArrayAccess; use ArrayIterator; use Countable; use Iterator; class ParameterContainer implements Iterator, ArrayAccess, Countable { public function __construct(array $data = []) /** methods to interact with values */ public function offsetExists(string|int $name) : bool; public function offsetGet(string|int $name) : mixed; public function offsetSetReference(string|int $name, string|int $from) : void; public function offsetSet(string|int $name, mixed $value, mixed $errata = null, int $maxLength = null) : void; public function offsetUnset(string|int $name) : void; /** set values from array (will reset first) */ public function setFromArray(array $data) : ParameterContainer; /** methods to interact with value errata */ public function offsetSetErrata(string|int $name, mixed $errata) : void; public function offsetGetErrata(string|int $name) : mixed; public function offsetHasErrata(string|int $name) : bool; public function offsetUnsetErrata(string|int $name) : void; /** errata only iterator */ public function getErrataIterator() : ArrayIterator; /** get array with named keys */ public function getNamedArray() : array; /** get array with int keys, ordered by position */ public function getPositionalArray() : array; /** iterator: */ public function count() : int; public function current() : mixed; public function next() : mixed; public function key() : string|int; public function valid() : bool; public function rewind() : void; /** merge existing array of parameters with existing parameters */ public function merge(array $parameters) : ParameterContainer; } In addition to handling parameter names and values, the container will assist in tracking parameter types for PHP type to SQL type handling. For example, it might be important that: $container->offsetSet('limit', 5); be bound as an integer. To achieve this, pass in the ParameterContainer::TYPE_INTEGER constant as the 3rd parameter: $container->offsetSet('limit', 5, $container::TYPE_INTEGER); This will ensure that if the underlying driver supports typing of bound parameters, that this translated information will also be passed along to the actual php database driver.

' SET ' . $qi('name') . ' = ' . $fp('name') . ' WHERE ' . $qi('id') .

The end result of a Laminas\\Db\\Sql object will be to either produce a Statement and ParameterContainer that represents the target query, or a full string that can be directly executed against the database platform. To achieve this, Laminas\\Db\\Sql objects require a Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter object in order to produce the desired results. Quick start There are four primary tasks associated with interacting with a database defined by Data Manipulation Language (DML): selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting. As such, there are four primary classes that developers can interact with in order to build queries in the Laminas\\Db\\Sql namespace: Select , Insert , Update , and Delete . Since these four tasks are so closely related and generally used together within the same application, the Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql class helps you create them and produce the result you are attempting to achieve. use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql; $sql = new Sql($adapter); $select = $sql->select(); // returns a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select instance $insert = $sql->insert(); // returns a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Insert instance $update = $sql->update(); // returns a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Update instance $delete = $sql->delete(); // returns a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Delete instance As a developer, you can now interact with these objects, as described in the sections below, to customize each query. Once they have been populated with values, they are ready to either be prepared or executed. To prepare (using a Select object): use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql; $sql = new Sql($adapter); $select = $sql->select(); $select->from('foo'); $select->where(['id' => 2]); $statement = $sql->prepareStatementForSqlObject($select); $results = $statement->execute(); To execute (using a Select object) use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql; $sql = new Sql($adapter); $select = $sql->select(); $select->from('foo'); $select->where(['id' => 2]); $selectString = $sql->buildSqlString($select); $results = $adapter->query($selectString, $adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE); Laminas\\\\Db\\\\Sql\\\\Sql objects can also be bound to a particular table so that in obtaining a Select , Insert , Update , or Delete instance, the object will be seeded with the table: use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql; $sql = new Sql($adapter, 'foo'); $select = $sql->select(); $select->where(['id' => 2]); // $select already has from('foo') applied Common interfaces for SQL implementations Each of these objects implements the following two interfaces: interface PreparableSqlInterface { public function prepareStatement(Adapter $adapter, StatementInterface $statement) : void; } interface SqlInterface { public function getSqlString(PlatformInterface $adapterPlatform = null) : string; } Use these functions to produce either (a) a prepared statement, or (b) a string to execute. Select Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select presents a unified API for building platform-specific SQL SELECT queries. Instances may be created and consumed without Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Sql : use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select; $select = new Select(); // or, to produce a $select bound to a specific table $select = new Select('foo'); If a table is provided to the Select object, then from() cannot be called later to change the name of the table. Once you have a valid Select object, the following API can be used to further specify various select statement parts: class Select extends AbstractSql implements SqlInterface, PreparableSqlInterface { const JOIN_INNER = 'inner'; const JOIN_OUTER = 'outer'; const JOIN_LEFT = 'left'; const JOIN_RIGHT = 'right'; const SQL_STAR = '*'; const ORDER_ASCENDING = 'ASC'; const ORDER_DESCENDING = 'DESC'; public $where; // @param Where $where public function __construct(string|array|TableIdentifier $table = null); public function from(string|array|TableIdentifier $table) : self; public function columns(array $columns, bool $prefixColumnsWithTable = true) : self; public function join(string|array|TableIdentifier $name, string $on, string|array $columns = self::SQL_STAR, string $type = self::JOIN_INNER) : self; public function where(Where|callable|string|array|PredicateInterface $predicate, string $combination = Predicate\\PredicateSet::OP_AND) : self; public function group(string|array $group); public function having(Having|callable|string|array $predicate, string $combination = Predicate\\PredicateSet::OP_AND) : self; public function order(string|array $order) : self; public function limit(int $limit) : self; public function offset(int $offset) : self; } from() // As a string: $select->from('foo'); // As an array to specify an alias // (produces SELECT \"t\".* FROM \"table\" AS \"t\") $select->from(['t' => 'table']); // Using a Sql\\TableIdentifier: // (same output as above) $select->from(['t' => new TableIdentifier('table')]); columns() // As an array of names $select->columns(['foo', 'bar']); // As an associative array with aliases as the keys // (produces 'bar' AS 'foo', 'bax' AS 'baz') $select->columns([ 'foo' => 'bar', 'baz' => 'bax' ]); // Sql function call on the column // (produces CONCAT_WS('/', 'bar', 'bax') AS 'foo') $select->columns([ 'foo' => new \\Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Expression(\"CONCAT_WS('/', 'bar', 'bax')\") ]); join() $select->join( 'foo', // table name 'id = bar.id', // expression to join on (will be quoted by platform object before insertion), ['bar', 'baz'], // (optional) list of columns, same requirements as columns() above $select::JOIN_OUTER // (optional), one of inner, outer, left, right also represented by constants in the API ); $select ->from(['f' => 'foo']) // base table ->join( ['b' => 'bar'], // join table with alias 'f.foo_id = b.foo_id' // join expression ); where(), having() Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select provides bit of flexibility as it regards to what kind of parameters are acceptable when calling where() or having() . The method signature is listed as: /** * Create where clause * * @param Where|callable|string|array $predicate * @param string $combination One of the OP_* constants from Predicate\\PredicateSet * @return Select */ public function where($predicate, $combination = Predicate\\PredicateSet::OP_AND); If you provide a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Where instance to where() or a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Having instance to having() , any previous internal instances will be replaced completely. When either instance is processed, this object will be iterated to produce the WHERE or HAVING section of the SELECT statement. If you provide a PHP callable to where() or having() , this function will be called with the Select 's Where / Having instance as the only parameter. This enables code like the following: $select->where(function (Where $where) { $where->like('username', 'ralph%'); }); If you provide a string , this string will be used to create a Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Predicate\\Expression instance, and its contents will be applied as-is, with no quoting: // SELECT \"foo\".* FROM \"foo\" WHERE x = 5 $select->from('foo')->where('x = 5'); If you provide an array with integer indices, the value can be one of: a string; this will be used to build a Predicate\\Expression . any object implementing Predicate\\PredicateInterface . In either case, the instances are pushed onto the Where stack with the $combination provided (defaulting to AND ). As an example: // SELECT \"foo\".* FROM \"foo\" WHERE x = 5 AND y = z $select->from('foo')->where(['x = 5', 'y = z']); If you provide an associative array with string keys, any value with a string key will be cast as follows: PHP value Predicate type null Predicate\\IsNull array Predicate\\In string Predicate\\Operator , where the key is the identifier. As an example: // SELECT \"foo\".* FROM \"foo\" WHERE \"c1\" IS NULL AND \"c2\" IN (?, ?, ?) AND \"c3\" IS NOT NULL $select->from('foo')->where([ 'c1' => null, 'c2' => [1, 2, 3], new \\Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Predicate\\IsNotNull('c3'), ]); As another example of complex queries with nested conditions e.g. SELECT * WHERE (column1 is null or column1 = 2) AND (column2 = 3) you need to use the nest() and unnest() methods, as follows: $select->where->nest() // bracket opened ->isNull('column1') ->or ->equalTo('column1', '2') ->unnest(); // bracket closed ->equalTo('column2', '3'); order() $select = new Select; $select->order('id DESC'); // produces 'id' DESC $select = new Select; $select ->order('id DESC') ->order('name ASC, age DESC'); // produces 'id' DESC, 'name' ASC, 'age' DESC $select = new Select; $select->order(['name ASC', 'age DESC']); // produces 'name' ASC, 'age' DESC limit() and offset() $select = new Select; $select->limit(5); // always takes an integer/numeric $select->offset(10); // similarly takes an integer/numeric Insert The Insert API: class Insert implements SqlInterface, PreparableSqlInterface { const VALUES_MERGE = 'merge'; const VALUES_SET = 'set'; public function __construct(string|TableIdentifier $table = null); public function into(string|TableIdentifier $table) : self; public function columns(array $columns) : self; public function values(array $values, string $flag = self::VALUES_SET) : self; } As with Select , the table may be provided during instantiation or via the into() method. columns() $insert->columns(['foo', 'bar']); // set the valid columns values() The default behavior of values is to set the values. Successive calls will not preserve values from previous calls. $insert->values([ 'col_1' => 'value1', 'col_2' => 'value2', ]); To merge values with previous calls, provide the appropriate flag: Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Insert::VALUES_MERGE $insert->values(['col_2' => 'value2'], $insert::VALUES_MERGE); Update class Update { const VALUES_MERGE = 'merge'; const VALUES_SET = 'set'; public $where; // @param Where $where public function __construct(string|TableIdentifier $table = null); public function table(string|TableIdentifier $table) : self; public function set(array $values, string $flag = self::VALUES_SET) : self; public function where(Where|callable|string|array|PredicateInterface $predicate, string $combination = Predicate\\PredicateSet::OP_AND) : self; } set() $update->set(['foo' => 'bar', 'baz' => 'bax']); where() See the section on Where and Having . Delete class Delete { public $where; // @param Where $where public function __construct(string|TableIdentifier $table = null); public function from(string|TableIdentifier $table); public function where(Where|callable|string|array|PredicateInterface $predicate, string $combination = Predicate\\PredicateSet::OP_AND) : self; } where() See the section on Where and Having . Where and Having In the following, we will talk about Where ; note, however, that Having utilizes the same API. Effectively, Where and Having extend from the same base object, a Predicate (and PredicateSet ). All of the parts that make up a WHERE or HAVING clause that are AND'ed or OR'd together are called predicates . The full set of predicates is called a PredicateSet . A Predicate generally contains the values (and identifiers) separate from the fragment they belong to until the last possible moment when the statement is either prepared (parameteritized) or executed. In parameterization, the parameters will be replaced with their proper placeholder (a named or positional parameter), and the values stored inside an Adapter\\ParameterContainer . When executed, the values will be interpolated into the fragments they belong to and properly quoted. In the Where / Having API, a distinction is made between what elements are considered identifiers ( TYPE_IDENTIFIER ) and which are values ( TYPE_VALUE ). There is also a special use case type for literal values ( TYPE_LITERAL ). All element types are expressed via the Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\ExpressionInterface interface. Literals In Laminas 2.1, an actual Literal type was added. Laminas\\Db\\Sql now makes the distinction that literals will not have any parameters that need interpolating, while Expression objects might have parameters that need interpolating. In cases where there are parameters in an Expression , Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\AbstractSql will do its best to identify placeholders when the Expression is processed during statement creation. In short, if you don't have parameters, use Literal objects. The Where and Having API is that of Predicate and PredicateSet : // Where & Having extend Predicate: class Predicate extends PredicateSet { public $and; public $or; public $AND; public $OR; public $NEST; public $UNNEST; public function nest() : Predicate; public function setUnnest(Predicate $predicate) : void; public function unnest() : Predicate; public function equalTo( int|float|bool|string $left, int|float|bool|string $right, string $leftType = self::TYPE_IDENTIFIER, string $rightType = self::TYPE_VALUE ) : self;

In code, the interface resembles: namespace Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSetInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Where; interface TableGatewayInterface { public function getTable() : string; public function select(Where|callable|string|array $where = null) : ResultSetInterface; public function insert(array $set) : int; public function update( array $set, Where|callable|string|array $where = null, array $joins = null ) : int; public function delete(Where|callable|string|array $where) : int; } There are two primary implementations of the TableGatewayInterface , AbstractTableGateway and TableGateway . The AbstractTableGateway is an abstract basic implementation that provides functionality for select() , insert() , update() , delete() , as well as an additional API for doing these same kinds of tasks with explicit Laminas\\Db\\Sql objects: selectWith() , insertWith() , updateWith() , and deleteWith() . In addition, AbstractTableGateway also implements a \"Feature\" API, that allows for expanding the behaviors of the base TableGateway implementation without having to extend the class with this new functionality. The TableGateway concrete implementation simply adds a sensible constructor to the AbstractTableGateway class so that out-of-the-box, TableGateway does not need to be extended in order to be consumed and utilized to its fullest. Quick start The following example uses Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway , which defines the following API: namespace Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSet; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSetInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\TableIdentifier; class TableGateway extends AbstractTableGateway { public $lastInsertValue; public $table; public $adapter; public function __construct( string|TableIdentifier $table, AdapterInterface $adapter, Feature\\AbstractFeature|Feature\\FeatureSet|Feature\\AbstractFeature[] $features = null, ResultSetInterface $resultSetPrototype = null, Sql\\Sql $sql = null ); /** Inherited from AbstractTableGateway */ public function isInitialized() : bool; public function initialize() : void; public function getTable() : string; public function getAdapter() : AdapterInterface; public function getColumns() : array; public function getFeatureSet() Feature\\FeatureSet; public function getResultSetPrototype() : ResultSetInterface; public function getSql() | Sql\\Sql; public function select(Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where = null) : ResultSetInterface; public function selectWith(Sql\\Select $select) : ResultSetInterface; public function insert(array $set) : int; public function insertWith(Sql\\Insert $insert) | int; public function update( array $set, Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where = null, array $joins = null ) : int; public function updateWith(Sql\\Update $update) : int; public function delete(Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where) : int; public function deleteWith(Sql\\Delete $delete) : int; public function getLastInsertValue() : int; } The concrete TableGateway object uses constructor injection for getting dependencies and options into the instance. The table name and an instance of an Adapter are all that is required to create an instance. Out of the box, this implementation makes no assumptions about table structure or metadata, and when select() is executed, a simple ResultSet object with the populated Adapter 's Result (the datasource) will be returned and ready for iteration. use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway; $projectTable = new TableGateway('project', $adapter); $rowset = $projectTable->select(['type' => 'PHP']); echo 'Projects of type PHP: ' . PHP_EOL; foreach ($rowset as $projectRow) { echo $projectRow['name'] . PHP_EOL; } // Or, when expecting a single row: $artistTable = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter); $rowset = $artistTable->select(['id' => 2]); $artistRow = $rowset->current(); var_dump($artistRow); The select() method takes the same arguments as Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select::where() ; arguments will be passed to the Select instance used to build the SELECT query. This means the following is possible: use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select; $artistTable = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter); // Search for at most 2 artists who's name starts with Brit, ascending: $rowset = $artistTable->select(function (Select $select) { $select->where->like('name', 'Brit%'); $select->order('name ASC')->limit(2); }); TableGateway Features The Features API allows for extending the functionality of the base TableGateway object without having to polymorphically extend the base class. This allows for a wider array of possible mixing and matching of features to achieve a particular behavior that needs to be attained to make the base implementation of TableGateway useful for a particular problem. With the TableGateway object, features should be injected through the constructor. The constructor can take features in 3 different forms: as a single Feature instance as a FeatureSet instance as an array of Feature instances There are a number of features built-in and shipped with laminas-db: GlobalAdapterFeature : the ability to use a global/static adapter without needing to inject it into a TableGateway instance. This is only useful when you are extending the AbstractTableGateway implementation: use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\AbstractTableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\Feature; class MyTableGateway extends AbstractTableGateway { public function __construct() { $this->table = 'my_table'; $this->featureSet = new Feature\\FeatureSet(); $this->featureSet->addFeature(new Feature\\GlobalAdapterFeature()); $this->initialize(); } } // elsewhere in code, in a bootstrap Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\Feature\\GlobalAdapterFeature::setStaticAdapter($adapter); // in a controller, or model somewhere $table = new MyTableGateway(); // adapter is statically loaded MasterSlaveFeature : the ability to use a master adapter for insert() , update() , and delete() , but switch to a slave adapter for all select() operations. $table = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter, new Feature\\MasterSlaveFeature($slaveAdapter)); MetadataFeature : the ability populate TableGateway with column information from a Metadata object. It will also store the primary key information in case the RowGatewayFeature needs to consume this information. $table = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter, new Feature\\MetadataFeature()); EventFeature : the ability to compose a laminas-eventmanager EventManager instance within your TableGateway instance, and attach listeners to the various events of its lifecycle. See the section on lifecycle events below for more information on available events and the parameters they compose. $table = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter, new Feature\\EventFeature($eventManagerInstance)); RowGatewayFeature : the ability for select() to return a ResultSet object that upon iteration will return a RowGateway instance for each row. $table = new TableGateway('artist', $adapter, new Feature\\RowGatewayFeature('id')); $results = $table->select(['id' => 2]); $artistRow = $results->current(); $artistRow->name = 'New Name'; $artistRow->save(); TableGateway LifeCycle Events When the EventFeature is enabled on the TableGateway instance, you may attach to any of the following events, which provide access to the parameters listed. preInitialize (no parameters) postInitialize (no parameters) preSelect , with the following parameters: select , with type Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Select postSelect , with the following parameters: statement , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\StatementInterface result , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface resultSet , with type Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSetInterface preInsert , with the following parameters: insert , with type Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Insert postInsert , with the following parameters: statement with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\StatementInterface result with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface preUpdate , with the following parameters: update , with type Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Update postUpdate , with the following parameters: statement , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\StatementInterface result , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface preDelete , with the following parameters: delete , with type Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Delete postDelete , with the following parameters: statement , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\StatementInterface result , with type Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface Listeners receive a Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\Feature\\EventFeature\\TableGatewayEvent instance as an argument. Within the listener, you can retrieve a parameter by name from the event using the following syntax: $parameter = $event->getParam($paramName); As an example, you might attach a listener on the postInsert event as follows: use Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\ResultInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\Feature\\EventFeature\\TableGatewayEvent; use Laminas\\EventManager\\EventManager; /** @var EventManager $eventManager */ $eventManager->attach('postInsert', function (TableGatewayEvent $event) { /** @var ResultInterface $result */ $result = $event->getParam('result'); $generatedId = $result->getGeneratedValue(); // do something with the generated identifier... });","title":"Table Gateways"},{"location":"table-gateway/#table-gateways","text":"The Table Gateway subcomponent provides an object-oriented representation of a database table; its methods mirror the most common table operations. In code, the interface resembles: namespace Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSetInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\Where; interface TableGatewayInterface { public function getTable() : string; public function select(Where|callable|string|array $where = null) : ResultSetInterface; public function insert(array $set) : int; public function update( array $set, Where|callable|string|array $where = null, array $joins = null ) : int; public function delete(Where|callable|string|array $where) : int; } There are two primary implementations of the TableGatewayInterface , AbstractTableGateway and TableGateway . The AbstractTableGateway is an abstract basic implementation that provides functionality for select() , insert() , update() , delete() , as well as an additional API for doing these same kinds of tasks with explicit Laminas\\Db\\Sql objects: selectWith() , insertWith() , updateWith() , and deleteWith() . In addition, AbstractTableGateway also implements a \"Feature\" API, that allows for expanding the behaviors of the base TableGateway implementation without having to extend the class with this new functionality. The TableGateway concrete implementation simply adds a sensible constructor to the AbstractTableGateway class so that out-of-the-box, TableGateway does not need to be extended in order to be consumed and utilized to its fullest.","title":"Table Gateways"},{"location":"table-gateway/#quick-start","text":"The following example uses Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway , which defines the following API: namespace Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway; use Laminas\\Db\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSet; use Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSetInterface; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql; use Laminas\\Db\\Sql\\TableIdentifier; class TableGateway extends AbstractTableGateway { public $lastInsertValue; public $table; public $adapter; public function __construct( string|TableIdentifier $table, AdapterInterface $adapter, Feature\\AbstractFeature|Feature\\FeatureSet|Feature\\AbstractFeature[] $features = null, ResultSetInterface $resultSetPrototype = null, Sql\\Sql $sql = null ); /** Inherited from AbstractTableGateway */ public function isInitialized() : bool; public function initialize() : void; public function getTable() : string; public function getAdapter() : AdapterInterface; public function getColumns() : array; public function getFeatureSet() Feature\\FeatureSet; public function getResultSetPrototype() : ResultSetInterface; public function getSql() | Sql\\Sql; public function select(Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where = null) : ResultSetInterface; public function selectWith(Sql\\Select $select) : ResultSetInterface; public function insert(array $set) : int; public function insertWith(Sql\\Insert $insert) | int; public function update( array $set, Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where = null, array $joins = null ) : int; public function updateWith(Sql\\Update $update) : int; public function delete(Sql\\Where|callable|string|array $where) : int; public function deleteWith(Sql\\Delete $delete) : int; public function getLastInsertValue() : int; } The concrete TableGateway object uses constructor injection for getting dependencies and options into the instance. The table name and an instance of an Adapter are all that is required to create an instance. Out of the box, this implementation makes no assumptions about table structure or metadata, and when select() is executed, a simple ResultSet object with the populated Adapter 's Result (the datasource) will be returned and ready for iteration. use Laminas\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway; $projectTable = new TableGateway('project', $adapter); $rowset = $projectTable->select(['type' => 'PHP']); echo 'Projects of type PHP: ' . PHP_EOL; foreach ($rowset as $projectRow) { echo $projectRow['name'] .
